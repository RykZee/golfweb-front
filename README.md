# GolfwebFront

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The application is hardcoded to communicate with REST API at `http://localhost:8080/userapi/users/` with the GolfWeb Spring Boot application. If you need to change the address change the `const` at `src/app/app.component.ts`.
